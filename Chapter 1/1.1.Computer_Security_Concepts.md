#Computer Security Concepts
### Cryptography algorithms and protocols
* Symmetric encryption: Conceal the contents of blocks or streams of data of any size
* Asymmetric encryption: Conceal small blocks of data, used in digital signature.
* Data integrity: Protects blocks of data
* Authentication protocols: Authenticate the identity of entities.

### Computer Security
* Computer Security = CIA triad = Confidentiality + Integrity + Available

* Confidentiality = Data Confidentiality + Privacy

* Integrity = Data Integrity + System Integrity

In additional, we have the following concepts:

* Authenticity: Determines accuracy access identity

* Accountability: Trace uniquely an entity. Systems must keep activities records for later forensic analysis.

### Three levels of impact on organizations or individuals should there be a breach of security

* Low
* Moderate
* High
